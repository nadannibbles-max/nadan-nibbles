# nadan-nibbles
A simple project inspired by the authentic flavours of Kerala. Nadan Nibbles celebrates traditional recipes, homely cooking, and the warm food culture of Trivandrum. Built to reflect the charm of a local kitchen, this project highlights genuine Kerala taste in a modern, minimal way.
